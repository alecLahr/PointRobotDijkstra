# PointRobotDijkstra

Robert Nick Vandemark and Alec Lahr  |  ENPM661  |  Project 3  |  Dijkstra and A* Search

----------

Perform Dijkstra's or A* algorithm and visualize the generated
path from start to goal positions, with obstacles avoided using
half-plane models. Ran with Python3.

- Run Vandemark_Lahr_D.py for phase 1 (Dijkstra)
- Run Vandemark_Lahr_A.py for phase 2 (A*)

Each program prompts the user for six inputs:
- The start position (y,x)
- The goal position (y,x)
- The robot radius (a positive integer)
- The clearance the robot needs from obstacles (a nonnegative integer)
- The movement step size (from 1 to 10 inclusive)
- The name of the video should just be a simple name with no extension
  (it will be an MP4 product)

To run, simply execute the program in a console environment.
