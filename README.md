# PointRobotDijkstra

Perform Dijkstra's or A* algorithm and visualize the generated
path from start to goal positions, with obstacles avoided using
semi-algebraic models. Ran with Python3.

This program prompts the user for six inputs:
- The start position (y,x)
- The goal position (y,x)
- The "robot" radius (a positive integer)
- The clearance the robot needs from obstacles (nonnegative int)
- Whether to use Dijkstra or A*
- The name of the video should just be a simple name with no extension
(it will be an MP4 product)

To run, simply execute Runner.py in a console environment.
